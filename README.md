# ✨ LustraGlow - Animated Landing Page

**LustraGlow** is a fully animated and responsive landing page built using **React JS**. The entire website is designed from scratch, starting with a custom layout created in **Figma**, followed by implementation and scroll-based animations using modern tools like **Framer Motion** and **react-intersection-observer**.

## 🎨 Design First Approach

I started by designing the full layout and structure in Figma to visualize the flow and sections.  
You can check out the design here:

## ⚙️ Features

- 🎬 Smooth scroll-based animations using **Framer Motion**
- 👁️ Reactive animation triggers using **react-intersection-observer**
- 🧩 Built completely with **React JS**
- 🎨 Styled using **CSS Modules** for scoped, maintainable styling
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 💫 Designed from scratch in **Figma** before development

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React JS**
- **Framer Motion**
- **react-intersection-observer**
- **CSS Modules**
- **Figma** (for design)

## 🎯 How It Works

By combining `react-intersection-observer` and `Framer Motion`, each section of the page animates into view as it enters the user’s screen. This creates a smooth and engaging browsing experience, especially suited for modern landing pages.
